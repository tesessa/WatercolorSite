			<p>Hi my name is Tessa Andersen and I like to watercolor. I have been watercoloring since I was about 13, in 7th grade. That year for Christmas I got an art set with a lot of watercolors in it. I started watercoloring the next year for my mom for Mother's day. Since then I have been watercoloring for both of my parents for their birthdays and Mothers and Fathers day. Over the years I've improved a lot and have even made some watercolors for my roommates and friends, not just family. Below I will showcase some of my different watercolors over the years. Someday soon I hope to be selling them. Thanks for chekcing out my work</p>
