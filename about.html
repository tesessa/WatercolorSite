			<p>Hi my names is Tessa Andersen and I have been watercoloring since I was about 12/13. I started watercoloring little things of fruits and have improved and I now watercolor people and places I've been too. I also like to watercolor Disney characters. I have always been mainly inspired by vactions I've been on with my family. Right now I watercolor for my friends and family as gifts, but someday I hope to be able to sell my watercolors. </p>

			<p>Right now I am attending BYU Provo and getting a degree in Computer Science. I am from Boise, Idaho and have 3 older brothers and no sisters. I like to play piano, watercolor, and read. I love going on many different vacations with my family and playing games with my family and friends. I plan on going a mission this year and to someday get a Phd in Computer Science. </p>
